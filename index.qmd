## Introduction

This document is a minimal working example (MWE) of a Quarto project rendered
with the `kaohandt` document class from the **kaobook** family. It uses
**XeLaTeX** as the PDF engine and exercises the wide-margin layout that
`kaohandt` provides.

## Margin Notes and Layout

The `kaohandt` class is based on `scrartcl` (KOMA-Script) and reserves a
generous right margin for annotations. Below we place a margin note to verify
that the sidenote machinery is functional.

This sentence demonstrates the margin-note feature.\marginnote{This is a test
sidenote. It appears in the outer margin thanks to the \texttt{marginnote}
package loaded by \texttt{kao.sty}.}

## Sample Equation

The wider margin also benefits mathematical documents. Here is the
Maxwell--Faraday equation in differential form:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

And a numbered inline equation testing the math renderer:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

## Conclusion

If this document compiles successfully, the `kaohandt` class is correctly
configured for Quarto with XeLaTeX, including local `.cls` and `.sty` file
resolution and system font support via `fontspec`.
